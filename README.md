# Fantastic Day Planner!

This is a very straight-forward day planner. It spans the usual business hours (9am to 5pm) and can accomodate more hours with additional programming. 

It allows the user to store the data so that if they have to close the window and re-open it the data will still be there.

## Installation

This code just utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. So long as the file structure remains intact it should run without problems.


## Usage

In the center column, just input whatever you have scheduled for the appropriate hour. You can put in as much or as little text as needed- you will be able to scroll through each row without having to alter the size of the screen too much. Once you've put the activities into the text field, push the blue "save" button to the right. That will lock the schedule into place, so if you have to refresh the page the data will save. So if you plan on using this just remember- save often.

At the bottom there is a "clear day" feature that will allow you to wipe all stored data so you can start fresh.


## Contributing

Same as usual- Any input it appreciated. Needlessly hurtful criticism will just be ignored (to the best of my ability.)


## Current iteration

0.1  The html, css, and Javascript seem to be functioning properly. This is the bare minimum I'd consider for the first iteration. 


## Future Development Plans

- "Clear Day" should also clear existing schedule fields

- There is a LOT more HTML than there needs to be here. I can probably simplify it A LOT with more javascript an jQuery.
